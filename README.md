# Case study â€“ Casualities on Palestine-Israel Conflict
The Israel-Palestine conflict is a long-standing and deeply rooted political and territorial dispute
between terrorist Israelis and Palestinians. The conflict has its roots in the late 19th and early
20th century when nationalist movements emerged among Jews and Arabs in the
Middle East. Since then, Israel has launched several military expeditions to spread terrorism
in the region. <br>
In this case study, I've data from different official reports to analyze the mass
destruction and fatalities in the region. I apply the different mathematic and programming skills to:
1. Explore the dataset and identify the trends in fatalities over time. Identify any significant
changes, spikes, or declines in the number of fatalities.
2. Analyze by examining the age, gender, and citizenship of the individuals killed.
Determine if there are any notable patterns or disparities in the data.
3. Visualize the distribution of fatalities and identify areas that have experienced higher
levels of violence.
4. Examine the types of injuries inflicted on individuals. Identify the most common types of
injuries and assess their severity.
5. Analyze the ammunition and means by which the individuals were killed. Determine the
most frequently used weapons or methods and evaluate their impact.
6. Create profiles of the victims based on the available data such as age, gender, citizenship,
and place of residence. Identify common characteristics among the victims.

I've analyzed the fatalities of Palestinians and Israelis and visualized them to easily understand the trends and patterns and compare the fatalities based on different parameters including citizenship, gender, and district.
I've also compared fatalities based on ammunition used and type of injuries.

Let's get into it's detail. We can see that according to the data
* Israel fatalities compared to Palestinians are very less (aate mai namak ke brabar). 
* The most affected victims are Palestinians of adult age. 
* The Israelis most affected age group is senior adults.
* The most affected victims are males of adult age.
* The least affected victims are females of adult age.
* The fatalities of whole(M+F) Israel(1029) are less than only females fatalities of Palestine(1091).
* The most affected district is Gaza(21.9%) and then North Gaza(17.9%). Israel is in 6th number with only 6.1% fatalities.
* The most injury type is gunfire(88.5%).
* The most ammunition used is unknown(47.2%) and then missile(25.9%).
* 89.9% of victims are affected by Israeli security forces, 9.2% from Palestinian civilians, and 0.9% from Israeli civilians.
* There was a huge spike in the year 2014.
* In the notes, the Most used word is 'Killed'. Other common words are soldier, shot, gunfire, Killed together, Exchange, friend, died, injured, home, house, military branch, Hamas military, Israel security, etc.

This is just a little contribution to keep people knowledgeable about the history and trends. <br>
